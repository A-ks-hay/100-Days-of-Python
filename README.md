# 100-Days-of-Python

# Day 1: Hello World, printing.

# What I Learned

Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language.

The print() function is used to display messages or output on the screen.

Strings (text) are written inside quotes " " or ' '.


# Day 2: Variables in Python

# What I Learned

Variables store data values.

No need to declare data types — Python assigns automatically.

Naming rules for variables are important.

# Day 3: Input and Output in python

# What I Learned

How to take user input using the input() function

How to convert input data types (e.g., from string to integer using int() or float())

How to display output using the print() function

The difference between simple printing and formatted printing

# Day 4: Operators in Python

# What I Learned

Arithmetic Operators:Used for basic mathematical operations.

Comparison (Relational) Operators:Used to compare two values.

Logical Operators:Used to combine multiple conditions.

Bitwise Operators:Operate on binary numbers.

Assignment Operators:Used to assign and update variable values.

Identity Operators:Used to compare memory locations of two objects.

Membership Operators:Used to check if a value exists in a sequence (like list, string, tuple).

Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression):Used to write simple if-else conditions in one line.

# Day 5: Conditional Statements in Python
