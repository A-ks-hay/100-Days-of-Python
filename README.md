# 100-Days-of-Python
Day 1: Hello World, printing.

What I Learned

Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language.

The print() function is used to display messages or output on the screen.

Strings (text) are written inside quotes " " or ' '.

Day 2: Variables in Python

What I Learned

Variables store data values.

No need to declare data types â€” Python assigns automatically.

Naming rules for variables are important.
