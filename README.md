# 100-Days-of-Python
Day 1: Hello World, printing.

What I Learned

Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language.

The print() function is used to display messages or output on the screen.

Strings (text) are written inside quotes " " or ' '.


Day 2: Variables in Python

What I Learned

Variables store data values.

No need to declare data types â€” Python assigns automatically.

Naming rules for variables are important.

Day 3: Input and Output in python

What I Learned

How to take user input using the input() function

How to convert input data types (e.g., from string to integer using int() or float())

How to display output using the print() function

The difference between simple printing and formatted printing

Day 4: Operators in Python

What I Learned

Arithmetic Operators:Used for basic mathematical operations.

Comparison (Relational) Operators:Used to compare two values.

Logical Operators:Used to combine multiple conditions.

Bitwise Operators:Operate on binary numbers.

Assignment Operators:Used to assign and update variable values.

Identity Operators:Used to compare memory locations of two objects.

Membership Operators:Used to check if a value exists in a sequence (like list, string, tuple).

Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression):Used to write simple if-else conditions in one line.

Day 5: Conditional Statements in Python

Topics Covered:

if statement

if-else statement

if-elif-else ladder

Nested if statements

Logical operators (and, or, not) with conditions

Ternary Operator

What I Learned

How to control program flow using if, elif, and else

How to use logical operators (and, or, not) in conditions

How nested if statements work

How to write compact conditions using the ternary operator

Decision-making is a core concept for real-world applications
